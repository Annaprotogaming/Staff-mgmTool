# Staff Management Tool
allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the staff data. The code includes a RESTful API controller with various endpoints for retrieving staff information, inserting new staff, updating staff information, and deleting staff records. The project also includes a DAO (Data Access Object) layer that uses Hibernate to interact with the MySQL database. Overall, this application provides a useful tool for managing staff records in a web-based environment.
The code follows the standard Spring Boot structure where annotations like @RestController, @Autowired, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, and @RequestBody are used to define the API endpoints, inject dependencies, and map the HTTP methods to specific methods in the controller
